# Operating Environments for ROS 2 Projects

ROS 2 is designed to be modular, scalable, and adaptable across a wide range of environmentsâ€”from embedded systems to cloud-based infrastructures. Choosing the right environment depends on your project's goals, hardware constraints, and deployment needs.

## Native Operating Systems

ROS 2 is primarily developed for Linux, but it also supports other platforms.

### Linux (Ubuntu Preferred)

- **Most supported and stable** environment for ROS 2.
- Official ROS 2 distributions are released for specific Ubuntu versions (e.g., Jammy, Focal).
- Ideal for development, simulation, and deployment on robots.

### Windows

- Supported but less commonly used in production.
- Useful for developers working in mixed environments or integrating with Windows-based software.

### macOS

- Experimental support.
- Good for prototyping or development, but not recommended for deployment.

## Containerized Environments

Containerization offers portability, reproducibility, and isolation.

### Docker

- Popular for packaging ROS 2 applications.
- Enables consistent environments across development, testing, and deployment.
- Useful for CI/CD pipelines and cloud deployment.

### Podman

- A daemonless alternative to Docker.
- Often used in secure or rootless environments.

### Kubernetes

- For orchestrating ROS 2 nodes at scale.
- Ideal for cloud robotics, distributed systems, and multi-robot coordination.

## Virtual Machines

Virtual machines provide full OS-level isolation.

- Useful for testing ROS 2 on different operating systems.
- Can simulate networked environments or legacy systems.
- Less efficient than containers but more flexible for OS-level experimentation.

## Cloud-Based Environments

ROS 2 can be extended into the cloud for scalability and remote access.

### AWS RoboMaker

- Offers simulation, deployment, and fleet management.
- Integrates with ROS 2 for cloud-based robotics workflows.

### Azure & Google Cloud

- Can host ROS 2 nodes in VMs or containers.
- Useful for data processing, remote control, and integration with cloud services (e.g., AI, storage).

### Remote Development (e.g., VS Code + SSH)

- Develop on a remote robot or server while using local tools.
- Ideal for low-powered robots or headless systems.

## Embedded and Edge Devices

ROS 2 is designed to run on resource-constrained devices.

### Raspberry Pi / NVIDIA Jetson

- Popular platforms for edge robotics.
- ROS 2 can be cross-compiled or installed natively.
- Often used in mobile robots, drones, and IoT applications.

### Microcontrollers (via micro-ROS)

- ROS 2 can be extended to microcontrollers using **micro-ROS**.
- Enables real-time communication with sensors and actuators.

## Simulation Environments

Simulation is essential for testing and development.

### Gazebo / Ignition

- Official simulators for ROS 2.
- Support physics-based simulation, sensor emulation, and multi-robot setups.

### Webots / Unity / RViz

- Alternative simulators for visualization, interaction, or custom environments.
