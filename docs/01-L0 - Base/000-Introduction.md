# Introduction

In this section, we will guide you through the essential concepts and components required for constructing a simple robot. You will learn about the basic structure, key parts such as motors and sensors, and the foundational steps needed to assemble and operate your robot.

This hardware project is a playground for exploring the capabilities of various hardware components and their integration into a cohesive system.
Due to the fact tht this is a private project, the focus is on the hardware and software that is affordable and accessible to the general public.
