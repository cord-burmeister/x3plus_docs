# Motivation

In recent years, the field of robotics has seen unprecedented growth, driven by advancements in hardware, artificial intelligence, and automation. Robots are no longer confined to industrial settings; they are becoming integral to healthcare, agriculture, logistics, and even our homes. However, building a functional and efficient robot remains a complex challenge, requiring a seamless integration of mechanical design, electronics, and software.

This project aims to have a environment to explore and learn in the world of robotics.

The motivation behind this project is the following:

* **Education and Learning**: Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that combines engineering, computer science, and mathematics. This project provides an opportunity to explore these domains in a hands-on manner.

* **New Technology**: By leveraging hardware components and open-source software, this project seeks to explore which capabilities are required to address certain use cases.

Ultimately, this project is driven by a vision to learn and explore robotics.
